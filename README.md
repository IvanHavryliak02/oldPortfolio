Hi there! My name is Ivan, and in this repository you can find my old portfolio.  
I closed this branch for several reasons:

1) The portfolio had a poor architecture â€” there was no `src` folder, so you could not see the built source code. Therefore, I started a big refactoring of the project.

2) When I created two branches (one for hosting on GitHub Pages, and one to show the full project), my local Git repository got broken. I had to remove the `.git` folder and restart the Git timeline from scratch.

I left this repository here so you can see how my (old and incomplete) portfolio was developing over time. It shows that I worked on it myself, and did not steal or buy someone else's work. ðŸ˜„

My current portfolio is available here: *link*
